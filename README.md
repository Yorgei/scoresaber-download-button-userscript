# scoresaber-download-button-userscript
don't like extensions so made a dodgy userscript to add download buttons for songs on scoresaber it might break it might not i did it for myself cool

# the stuff
![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yorgei/scoresaber-download-button-userscript/main/example.png)

icons left to right are:

one click install using mod assistant

open the song's beatsaver page (hint: use ctrl + click or middle mouse to open in a new tab life hack)

direct download link from beatsaver

copy the !bsr <songid> to your clipboard (i dont use this shit but it was in every extension i looked at)
